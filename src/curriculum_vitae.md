## Education

I went to Moscow State University, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, but dropped out.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science from Moscow Aviation Institute.

I've been participating in competitive programming contests since the 8th grade.

## Experience

**September 2020 - October 2020** - Zebrainy, backend developer. TypeScript, C#, IdentityServer4, MongoDB, Firebase, ffmpeg.

Wrote and deployed five small-but-not-quite-micro services. HTTP and docker-compose, no message queue.
Each had a single purpose: for example, one would distribute users into A/B testing groups according to a configuration in Firebase.

Wrote a couple of scripts for validating IdentityServer4 auth tokens and for converting videos into a streamable format.

**March 2020 - September 2020** - Strelka Institute, backend developer. TypeScript, PostgreSQL.

Wrote a backend for an event management system that stored manually and automatically ordered events and exposed both as a single feed.

Worked on integrating frontend and backend with a Keycloak SSO system.

**July 2018 - August 2019** - Yandex, UI developer. Mostly TypeScript.

Hooked into CI to update tasks in the task tracker based on changes in the Github repo.

Replaced custom build tools with Webpack and a custom plugin.

# Projects

I made vue-p5, a Vue component.
~85 github stars, ~300 dependent projects on Github, ~400 downloads/week.

I wrote a Telegram bot in Rust.
Almost finished writing another one: it pulls game character stats from dndbeyond.com
using headless Chrome and lets Telegram users use those stats to roll dice.

Both are hosted as Docker containers on a DigitalOcean node at https://kinrany.dev/

I also wrote a parser/api for reading public game logs using Rust and a parser combinator library.

My graduate work was a C# graph drawing app. I also wrote a basic chat with client, server and a NoSQL database.

Started more than a dozen games in various languages. Haven't finished any besides a single Ren'Py adventure, unfortunately.

## Skills

I know TypeScript and I am well familiar with the NPM ecosystem.

I'm currently learning Rust. My third favorite language is C#. I also used C++, Python and Lua.

This became less of a focus once I began learning Rust, but I'm interested in programming language research in general
and read a lot about new type systems. Two languages that seem particularly novel to me are Cue,
a non-Turing programming language for managing configuration, and Spiral, a language that uses the same syntax
for runtime and compile-time computation.

I'm comfortable with algorithms and data structures. I'm also good at using public documentation to learn new things.

My English is good enough that I use it 95% of the time. It seems to be between Upper-Intermediate and Advanced.

## Preferences

I strongly prefer statically typed languages for anything longer than a few hundred lines of code.

I want my work to be positive-sum. I won't work on gambling or stock market prediction.

I'd like to work on new projects and research-intensive problems, even if it means frequent setbacks.

My main non-technical interests are sociology, economics, epistemology, human behavior. I'm not an expert in any of these, but I'd love the overall goal of the organization to be related to these fields.
