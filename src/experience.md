## Experience

**September 2020 - October 2020** - Zebrainy, backend developer. TypeScript, C#, IdentityServer4, MongoDB, Firebase, ffmpeg.

Wrote and deployed five small-but-not-quite-micro services. HTTP and docker-compose, no message queue.
Each had a single purpose: for example, one would distribute users into A/B testing groups according to a configuration in Firebase.

Wrote a couple of scripts for validating IdentityServer4 auth tokens and for converting videos into a streamable format.

**March 2020 - September 2020** - Strelka Institute, backend developer. TypeScript, PostgreSQL.

Wrote a backend for an event management system that stored manually and automatically ordered events and exposed both as a single feed.

Worked on integrating frontend and backend with a Keycloak SSO system.

**July 2018 - August 2019** - Yandex, UI developer. Mostly TypeScript.

Hooked into CI to update tasks in the task tracker based on changes in the Github repo.

Replaced custom build tools with Webpack and a custom plugin.
