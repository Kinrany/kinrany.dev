## Skills

I'm a programming language polyglot. I prefer TypeScript and Rust, but I know C, C#, Python and Lua
and I'm familiar with lisps and statically typed functional languages.

Most of my professional experience was web-related. I can create from scratch and deploy
a website or web service with front end, back end and CI.

Before I found Rust (which is good enough for most things), I was very interested
in programming language research in general and read a lot about new type systems.
Two languages that seem particularly novel to me are [Cue], a non-Turing programming language
for managing configuration, and [Spiral], a language that uses the same syntax for runtime
and compile-time computation.

I'm comfortable with algorithms and data structures. I'm also good at using public documentation to learn new things.

My English is good enough that I use it 95% of the time. It seems to be between Upper-Intermediate and Advanced.
