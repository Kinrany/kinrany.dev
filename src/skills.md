## Skills

I know TypeScript and I am well familiar with the NPM ecosystem.

I'm currently learning Rust. My third favorite language is C#. I also used C++, Python and Lua.

This became less of a focus once I began learning Rust, but I'm interested in programming language research in general
and read a lot about new type systems. Two languages that seem particularly novel to me are Cue,
a non-Turing programming language for managing configuration, and Spiral, a language that uses the same syntax
for runtime and compile-time computation.

I'm comfortable with algorithms and data structures. I'm also good at using public documentation to learn new things.

My English is good enough that I use it 95% of the time. It seems to be between Upper-Intermediate and Advanced.
