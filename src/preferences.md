## Preferences

I strongly prefer statically typed languages for anything longer than a few hundred lines of code.

I want my work to be positive-sum. I won't work on gambling or stock market prediction.

I'd like to work on new projects and research-intensive problems, even if it means frequent setbacks.

My main non-technical interests are sociology, economics, epistemology, human behavior. I'm not an expert in any of these, but I'd love the overall goal of the organization to be related to these fields.
