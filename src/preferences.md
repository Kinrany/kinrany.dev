## Preferences

I strongly prefer statically typed languages for anything longer than a few hundred lines of code.

I want my work to be positive-sum. I won't work on gambling or stock market prediction.

I like new projects and research-intensive problems, even if it means frequent setbacks.

My main non-technical interests are sociology, economics, epistemology, human behavior. I'm not an expert in any of these, but I like things related to those fields.
