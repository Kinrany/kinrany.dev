## Projects

I made vue-p5, a Vue component.
~85 github stars, ~300 dependent projects on Github, ~400 downloads/week.

I wrote a Telegram bot in Rust.
Almost finished writing another one: it pulls game character stats from dndbeyond.com
using headless Chrome and lets Telegram users use those stats to roll dice.

Both are hosted as Docker containers on a DigitalOcean node at https://kinrany.dev/

I also wrote a parser/api for reading public game logs using Rust and a parser combinator library.

My graduate work was a C# graph drawing app. I also wrote a basic chat with client, server and a NoSQL database.

Started more than a dozen games in various languages. Haven't finished any besides a single Ren'Py adventure, unfortunately.
